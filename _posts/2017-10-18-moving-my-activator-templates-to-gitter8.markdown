I had few activater templates for a while now that I use to start different types of Scala projects. I open sourced those and made available via Github and activator website. There was lots of traction from the community and since Activator is deprecated now I decided to take those and convert to Gitter8 templates so `sbt new` can be used to start projects. The new templates work with sbt 1 and all the dependencies, including sbt plugins in the projects, are upgraded.

The old activator templates are still on my github and available for people who still use activator but new updates and patches will only be submitted to new g8 templates.
