      <p>Recently folks at <a href="https://www.replicated.com/" target="_blank">Replicated</a>
created an oper source tool called <a href="https://www.fromlatest.io/#/" target="_blank">FROM:latest</a>,
which is a linting tool for docker files. You put the content of your docker
file and it tries to find issues you have in it. Such a cool idea, I never
came across a tool like this for docker files before. I decided to try it with
the docker files I wrote in past to find potential issues in them and it
actually found few issues.</p>

      <p><em>Applicative</em> is <em>Apply</em> that also has <em>point</em> or <em>pure</em> methods.
Scalaz defines <em>Applicative[F[_]]</em> trait with <em>point</em> abstract method.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">point</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">A</span><span class="o">](</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">F</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">A</span><span class="o">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><em>point</em> method lifts A to F[A].
Since <em>Applicative</em> is <em>Apply</em> it inherits all the methods that <em>Apply</em>
offers plus it needs to provide implementation for <em>map</em> and <em>ap</em> methods.
Note that <em>Applicative</em> implements map using <em>point</em> and <em>ap</em> methods:</p>

      <p>Here at <a href="http://adhoclabs.co/" target="_blank">Ad Hoc Labs</a> we are open-sourcing one of the
projects I started to handle reliable execution of different tasks.</p>

<p>I wanted to build a library that would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a higher level of abstraction than queuing</li>
  <li>allow development of new types of tasks with only config changes</li>
  <li>be back-end independent, so backends like RabbitMQ and Kafka would work based on config</li>
  <li>allow flexibility to have publishers running in one project and consumers running in another</li>
  <li>allow flexibility to decide which projects run what consumers and producers and how many of them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our product <a href="http://burnerapp.com/" target="_blank">Burner</a> is a privacy layer for phone numbers.
There are many things we want to run in a reliable manner, and we need to queue tasks and
execute things in an asynchronous way. We are a Scala shop and among many Scala libraries
we also use Akka.</p>

<p>In the Akka world, we have actor A sending a message to actor B. There are many things that
can go wrong, even if both are running in same JVM. Actor B may be down when actor A is
sending the message. Actor B may fail to process the task, so there is a need for retries.
Some tasks can take long time to process, so there is a need to run things asynchronously.
You may want to scale out and have many instances of actor B, etc.</p>

<p>This actor model is very clean and well-suited for this type of situation. And if
you’re familiar with Akka, you know that Akka handles some of those cases out of the box,
some via Akka persistence, and some things simply aren’t there.</p>

<p>So I wanted to have a very simple library that wouldn’t require a Cassandra cluster, force
you to write a lot of boilerplate, or force the use one specific message queue – I wanted it
to be extremely flexible and extendable.</p>

<p>The core idea is the same: actor A sends a task to actor B to process, and actor B
will <em>eventually</em> get the task. It’s very similar to the way you send a message from actor A
to actor B in Akka; there’s no other complexity there.</p>

      <p>I was running <em>Raspbmc</em> in Raspberry Pi which I like to use once a year (but I’m
not gonna write about that part). What’s interesting about that device is that I
always have it on and it’s connected to my router, so it makes it a great
candidate for installing vpn server in it. And instead of getting another Pi to
run vpn server and keep it up and running 24/7, it’s a good idea to just install
OpenVpn on it also since it’s built on top of linux and that’s what I had. There
have been lot of changes to the project and it also changed it’s name to
<a href="https://osmc.tv/" target="_blank">OSMc</a>. So I just decided to reformat,
get OSMC and install OpenVpn on it again. Since I didn’t provision that server
with chef (would be interesting to see someone run chef client in Pi though)
I had to do everything manually again. Decided to write about it in case others
would be interested in creating similar setup also. And since OSMC is built on
top of Debian, this guide mostly applies to any Debian based setup.</p>

      <p>I have known about <a href="http://editorconfig.org/" target="_blank">EditorConfig</a>
for a while now but only recently decided to use it. It tells your editor to use
tabs or spaces, indent size, tab width, what the end of the line should be,
charset, whether to trim trailing whitespaces, add or not new lines at the end
of the file. And all this can be configured per file extension(s) and per
project. It supports pretty much all editors and IDEs out there, either they
support it naively or there is a plugin for it. I’m mostly using Vim so I went
ahead and installed the plugin for Vim. Most of the configuration it supports I
honestly already have in my vim config (partially that’s why I wasn’t in rush to
start using it). The only thing I needed it to solve for me was to remove trailing
whitespaces and add a new line for scala a java files (second one btw didn’t
work for me in Vim, not sure what the deal is there.) So obviously it does very
little for me, the real benefit of this project though is when other people are
also working on the same project. So you end up with consistent style and this
kind of things I always appreciate.</p>

      <p>A while ago I wrote a post about continuous integration with Jenkins for scala
projects and I thought I would do one for node developers also. Make sure to
check out my other posts about how to write your gulp files since we’ll heavily
really on those gulp tasks. I will put the links at the end of this post.
So what is continuous integration, at the very high level it’s about hey is
the code in a good state, no matter by how many people code is being updated,
how often code is being changed or of how many building blocks project consists of.
When you start working on a feature you’re gonna branch of mainline and start
introducing changes. At some point when you find things are broken now you have
to spend time to see if it’s because of your changes or project was already in
a bad state. And when you find out that it was already in a bad state you
would want to start tracing. A who introduced the breaking changes and B when.
So to avoid the head each and frustration what you really want to know is
if project is in a good state before you even start working on it.
One option would be to compile the code before you start changing it.
But if code compiles is it enough? Oh you you also wanna know if unit tests are
passing. But is this enough? Check for compiler warnings? Style violations?
Code coverage? What if you run code coverage and it shows that it’s 85%,
does it mean everything is good, what if code coverage was 95% last week and
code without proper code coverage got committed and code coverage dropped
(do you remember what code coverage was last week, can you even find
out without going back in commits and running coverage reports on those commits.) are you sure
you want to introduce your changes on top of those changes?
Let’s make it even more complex, what if the project consists of many other
projects and the project you’re working on brings all those dependencies
tougher. Maybe you should checkout all those dependency projects
and see if those are in a good state also.
Let’s make it even more complex, what if the project isn’t just set of
projects that get bundled into one big project.
What if the whole code base consists of many micro services that talk to each other
via some form of PRC. OK maybe you can manage to do all this to know if code is
in a good state before you introduce your changes what about the point B I
brought earlier about when code broke, because longer it was in that states
longer it’s gonna take to trace the breaking change and longer to fix.
Can you go and check every single project every time someone makes a commit
to make sure that commit is good? Well actually you can, you just need a
build server. So all those points I was bringing was about whatever your
integration is it should be continuous and it’s continuous if it runs after
somebody changes something (or maybe before is a better option?☺ I’ll get
to this later.)</p>

      <p>Recently I decided to upgrade to Gulp 4 even though it’s not released yet.
And since there are some breaking changes I had to go over my gulp files.
I usually do three type of projects in node/js, rest apis, library projects
(npm packages), ionic and angular apps. I decided to write blog posts and share
my gulp files in case other will find it useful. I do like to use the most loved
and hated language in node world, CoffeeScript. I sure give it some love here,
not because I find JavaScript hard or don’t know how to properly scope my
variables or make objects, but because I find code written in CoffeScript much
more readable and maintainable (yep, all that brackets and parentheses.)
Other libraries I religiously use are Chai and Mocka for unit testing, Istanbul
for code coverage, Sinon and Proxyquire for mocking, Jade for templates,
Sass for stylesheets and of course Jenkins for continuous integration. So this
combination on it’s own makes my gulp files pretty unique. Listing links to
individual posts where I have my gulp file and I’m explaining which task is
doing what.</p>

      <p>For this type of projects I use CoffeScript, Chai and Mocka for unit testing,
Istanbul for code coverage, Sinon and Proxyquire for mocking, Jenkins for
continuous integration. This type of projects are easy to build because those
don’t have front-end components, compilation/optimization, browser testing,
live reload etc. And for server side code we don’t need to compile CoffeeScript to
JavaScript since it’s running on server and we can use <em>coffee</em> executable to
run the code instead of <em>node</em> executable. I also use CoffeScript for my
gulpfile since it makes it much more clean and compact. Some people who do
that like to also create <em>gulpfile.js</em> file with</p>

we’re gonna publish the package with JavaScript code and not CoffeScript. What I
do is keep my coffee code in <em>src</em> directory instead of <em>lib</em>. At compile time I
generate JavaScript code into <em>lib</em> directory, add <em>src</em> directory to <em>.npmignore</em> and
<em>lib</em> directory to <em>.gitignore</em>. That way my CoffeeScript ends up in git repo but
not generated JavaScript and my JavaScript ends up in published package and not
JavaScript, pretty smart right :). I also use CoffeScript for my

      <p>For Ionic projects also I use CoffeeScript, Sass, Jade although ionic generates
the project in JavaScript and Html. Here we have front-end components,
compilation, browser testing, live reload, and all that goodness. Here we do
need to compile CoffeScript to JavaScript, Sass to Css and Jade to Html.
Another thing that needs to be solved since browser will run JavaScript, Css
and html instead of CoffeScript, Jade, Sass so debugging will be really
challenging. To solved that problem I generate source map files. I also use
CoffeScript for my gulpfile since it makes it much more clean and compact.
